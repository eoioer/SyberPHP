1.high performance, as fast as Java and Go.
2.Supports virtual hosting.
3.Customizable ORM libraries and view template libraries or other libraries.
4.Dozens of applications can run simultaneously under one framework, making maintenance convenient for one person.
5.Extremely high flexibility, through configuration files, applications can run in relation to each other or independently.

To facilitate incremental development, I did not separate the core files into a library. You should use and modify it according to your ideas and needs, rather than being constrained by its rules.
